Currency Exchange Rate comparison
Motivation
What specific investigation will the project carry out? In this project,We want to investigate about the Currency ExChange Rate comparison between different countries based on certain parameters.

Investigative Questions
What are the exchange rate of Indian Rupee and European Euro based upon the particular date?
Exchange rates of each country in range of date?
The currency exchange rate values are extracted based upon the date?
Approach
Description of the data set:

The dataset contains exchange rates of US Dollar to other currencies, i.e. 1 USD = x EUR.
The column index is a list of currencies and row index is a list of dates.
The dataset describes the exchange rates of most foreign currencies to US Dollar in the past years, i.e. 1 USD = x EUR
The economy has not been booming in recent years, so it could be interesting to look at the trends of some exchange rates and gain some insight out of it because exchange rates can be a great indicator of the economy.
Dataset Documentation
